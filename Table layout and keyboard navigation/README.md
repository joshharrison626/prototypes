# Table layout and keyboard navigation

The purpose of this prototype was to architect an appropriate HTML table layout that could support an expand/collapse function that is still keyboard and screen reader accessible.

Stretch goal was to support keyboard navigation for the editable cells as described in the [aria data-grid](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/examples/data-grids/) spec.

## Goals
1. Demonstrate an appropriate layout for supporting expand/collapse and multiple, editable inputs in either a single cell or multiple cells
2. Support keyboard navigation in the editable cells using up/down/left/right arrows and native tab/shift-tab
